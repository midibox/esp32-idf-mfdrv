# Motorfader Driver

## Introduction

This driver is originated from:

* the assembly based MBHP_MF_NG project: http://www.ucapps.de/mbhp_mf_ng.html
* C based MIOS32 variant (which is an older implementation): https://github.com/midibox/mios32/blob/master/mios32/common/mios32_mf.c

Currently used as a "Proof of Concept" for ESP32 based motorfader control.

Advantage: due to the dedicated PWM outputs of ESP32 we get much more accurate control over the motors.
